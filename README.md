# LED Bar Graph Display

#### Project Overview

The LED Bar Graph Display project demonstrates how to create a simple bar graph display using LEDs and an Arduino Nano. The bar graph consists of multiple LEDs arranged in a linear fashion, where each LED represents a specific data point or level. This project provides a basic setup for controlling the LEDs in the bar graph to display different patterns or levels.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **LEDs (Number depends on the desired length of the bar graph)**
3. **Resistors (to limit current flow through LEDs)**
4. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect LEDs to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect each LED's anode (longer lead) to digital output pins of the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect each LED's cathode (shorter lead) to a current-limiting resistor, then connect the other end of the resistor to the ground (GND) of the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper current-limiting resistors are used to prevent damage to the LEDs and Arduino.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the LEDs to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.
   - Arrange the LEDs in a linear fashion to represent the desired bar graph display.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LED bar graph display to see different patterns or levels.
   - Experiment with the code to customize the behavior of the LED bar graph according to your requirements.

#### Applications

- **Visual Feedback:** Use the LED bar graph display to provide visual feedback based on sensor readings or system status.
- **Level Indication:** Display levels of various parameters such as temperature, humidity, or sound intensity.
- **Progress Display:** Show progress or completion status of tasks or processes.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper current limiting to prevent excessive current flow through the LEDs.
- Adjust the delay time in the code to control the speed at which the LED bar graph updates.
- Experiment with different LED arrangements and display patterns to achieve desired visual effects.
